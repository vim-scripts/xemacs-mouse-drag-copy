In xemacs and emacs if it is enabled, there is a very handy way to copy and paste  without repositioning the cursor.  You press the control key, drag the mouse over some text, and when you release the mouse button the text will be inserted in the original position.  There is no need to move the position of the cursor.  Doing the same while pressing the shift key instead of the control key will move text instead of copying.  This script does these things in vim, for insert mode.
